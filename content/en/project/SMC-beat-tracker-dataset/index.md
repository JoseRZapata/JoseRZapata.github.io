title: "SMC Beat tracking Dataset"
summary: "This beat tracking dataset contains 217 excerpts around 40s each, of which 19 are *easy* and the remaining 198 are *hard*. This dataset has been designed for radically new techniques which can contend with challenging beat tracking situations like: quiet accompaniment, expressive timing, changes in time signature, slow tempo, poor sound quality etc. More details in [Selective Sampling for Beat Tracking Evaluation](https://joserzapata.github.io/publication/selectivesampling/)"
